# Predictive-Modelling-for-Agriculture
An vital part of evaluating soil health is measuring key soil parameters like pH, phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen levels. But because it can be a costly and time-consuming procedure, farmers may decide which indicators to measure first depending on their financial limitations.

When it comes to choosing which crop to grow each season, farmers have a number of alternatives. Taking many aspects into consideration, their main goal is to enhance agricultural productivity. The state of the soil in the field, which can be evaluated by testing for elements like potassium and nitrogen, is one important aspect that influences crop development. Every crop has the perfect soil conditions for healthy growth and optimum output.

The dataset provided for this project contains several informations about the soil. Those informations are :
-"N": Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
- "P": Phosphorous content ratio in the soil
- "K": Potassium content ratio in the soil
- "pH": value of the soil
- "crop": categorical values that contain various crops (target variable).

In this project, we will build multi-class classification models to find the single feature that has the strongest predictive performance for classifying crop types.
